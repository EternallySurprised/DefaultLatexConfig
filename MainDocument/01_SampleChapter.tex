\chapter{\myindex{First Sample Chapter}}	%% Define a chapter
\label{chap:FirstSampleChapter}				%% Label the chapter - so you can reference it elsewhere
Here is some text. We can use a topic referenced in the glossary by marking it. Like here for a \gls{precision}.
\\
\\
You can just put your text here. Latex takes care of all the nice formatting and stuff. Trust me, it's better than we humans are.
\\
\\
There might also be abbreviations (maybe also with glossary entries associated). An example: \gls{plc}.
\\
\\
You can also make things appear in the index later on, like this \myindex{Index Entry}.
\\
\\
Equations are also very nice. Like defining an uncorrected point cloud which might be: 
% 
 \begin{equation}
	P=\left\{ P_0, P_1,..., Pn \right\} \text{ for } n \in \mathrm{N} \text{ with } P_n \in \mathbb{R}^2
 \end{equation}
 %
 with:
 %
  \begin{equation}
 P_n=\left(\begin{array}{c}x_n\\ y_n\end{array}\right)
  \end{equation}
%
\\
\\
And of course you can also reference sources defined in the bibliography - like a pretty awesome book \cite{adams:hitchhikersguide} - which will then also appear in the bibliography.
